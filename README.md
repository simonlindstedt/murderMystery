## The Case:
<br>

The year is 2020, a man residing in Örgryte, Gothenburg, has passed away. The man, who was in his late 70s, is a retired CEO. When his relatives clean out his house for sale, skeletal parts are found in the basement. They call the police, who quickly treat the house as a crime scene. The body was found in a trunk in the mans’ basement and was covered with work clothes, marked ‘Women’ and size S, from the man’s previously owned company. The criminologists on site date these skeletal parts to be around 30-20 years old and belonging to a woman. They get no hits on DNA and the police can not identify her. **Who is the Jane Doe?**
